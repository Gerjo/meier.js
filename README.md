meier.js
========

After copy-pasting my own code around so many times, it seemed prudent to  derive a library of sorts.

Structure
=========

**/examples/**
Contains a hello world example. A demo has been published [here](http://gerjo.github.io/meier.js/examples/helloworld.html).

**/src/engine/** 
An actual engine *of sorts* ties a few components together.

**/src/math/**
Math oriented features.

**/src/aux/**
Optional files.

**/src/contrib/**
Code sourced from open source projects. Each file contains more details about its origin.
