meier.js
========

After copy-pasting my own code around so many times, it seemed prudent to  derive a library *of sorts*.

Structure
=========

**/examples/**
*<br>Contains typical usage examples:*
<br> online demo: [Animation and textures](http://gerjo.github.io/meier.js/examples/helloworld/helloworld.html)
<br> online demo: [The coordinate system](http://gerjo.github.io/meier.js/examples/grid/grid.html)

**/src/engine/** 
<br>*An actual engine, of sorts. Ties a few components together.*

**/src/math/**
<br>*Math oriented features.*

**/src/aux/**
<br>*Optional files. You won't need them, I do.*

**/src/contrib/**
<br>*Code sourced from open source projects. Each file contains more details about its origin.*
